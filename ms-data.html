          Data Science has become an important due to the need for analyzing and
          understanding ever increasing data generated by a multitude of
          sources. By getting admission in the MS programme applicants will not
          only improve their qualifications but will also be equipped with the
          latest knowledge in the field. The students will be exposed to
          different aspects of data science including programming, data
          structures, and algorithms for data science, data analysis and
          visualization, and big data analytics. These aspects will provide the
