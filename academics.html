          PhD is highest degree awarded in an academic discipline and is the
          most satisfying and rewarding educational experience. Students work
          closely with a faculty member, performing original research, and
          tackling challenging and unsolved problems.

          In today's Information Society, expertise in all forms of information
          is required for progress in science, business, and education. The main
          aim of MS programme in Information Science & Technology (IST) is to
          design and develop information related applications using information
          technology by understanding relationship between digital information,
          people and technology. The MS programme intends to bring together
          Computer Science and collaborative environment of how people and
          society interact with digital information MS (Information Science &
          Technology) Part Time (with 6 credit hours per semester) M.Sc.
          (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology) or 4
          years BS (Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information
          Technology) with experience in digital information management.

          Data Science has become an important due to the need for analyzing and
          understanding ever increasing data generated by a multitude of
          sources. By getting admission in the MS programme applicants will not
          only improve their qualifications but will also be equipped with the
          latest knowledge in the field. The students will be exposed to
          different aspects of data science including programming, data
          structures, and algorithms for data science, data analysis and
          visualization, and big data analytics. These aspects will provide the
          students the opportunities to effectively work in local and
          international markets as well as to pursue a PhD degree in data
          science.

            The BS Computer Science program at QAU provides a well-integrated
            balance of theoretical and practical knowledge required for
            developing reliable and usable software tools for different fields.
            The program enables students to design, implement and manage systems
            combining scientific, computational, communication and multimedia
            facilities in different domains. The main objective of the program
            is to provide students with a balanced breadth and depth of
            knowledge in Computer Science that enables them to begin their
            professional career in the software industry or they can continue
            their education at graduate level. In the final three semesters,
            students enhance their skills and knowledge in one of the following
            focus areas:
