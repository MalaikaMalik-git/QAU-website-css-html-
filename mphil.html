        <p class="program-desc">
          The objective of M.Phil Computer Science programme is to train
          students to initiate research work. The duration of M.Phil programme
          is two years (4 semesters).
        </p>
        <p class="program-desc">
          MPhil is of 50 credit hours, 24 credit hours for the course work and
          26 credit hours for research work. Each course is of 3 credit hours.
          There are 2 compulsory courses, and 6 optional courses are taken to
          complete 24 credits. The courses are designed in such a way that
          during the course work students will be exposed to research
          activities. The course work will set the basic ground work to start
          research.
